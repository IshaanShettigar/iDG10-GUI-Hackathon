* JointJS

We have used HTML,CSS and JS along with a JavaScript library called JointJS that allows developers to create and interact with diagrams and visualizations in web applications. We identified this library among a few other JavaScript libraries (MxGraph, facbricJS etc) because it fit the requirements of this project perfectly. 

    1. Interactivity: Users can interact with the diagrams by dragging and dropping shapes,
       resizing them, and connecting them with links.

    2. Plugin support: JointJS supports a wide range of plugins that can add additional functionality
       to the library, such as exporting diagrams to different file formats.

    3. Extensibility: JointJS can be extended with custom code to add new features and functionality,
       such as custom shapes or interactions.

    4. Real-time collaboration: JointJS supports real-time collaboration, allowing multiple users to edit and view the same diagram simultaneously.
    
    5. High performance: JointJS is designed to be highly performant, even with large and complex diagrams.
    
    6. Styling: JointJS allows developers to customize the styling of shapes and links, including colors, fonts, and border styles
